# Salary-Prediction-System
The goal of this project is to create a model that predicts employee salaries based on years of experience using data transformation and machine learning.
# Problem
Say a company's HR department wants you to build a model to predict new hire salaries based on company data. .csv file shows the data needed to train and test the model.

# Solution


Simple linear regression is used to solve this problem. This suggests that the model will make future decisions for the HR department to predict salaries based on applicant experience.
