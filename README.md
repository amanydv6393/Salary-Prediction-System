# Salary-Prediction-System
The goal of this project is to create a model that predicts employee salaries based on years of experience using data transformation and machine learning.

Dataset description:- The dataset is randomly created to show you how we can use machine learning techniques and build a linear regression model to predict the salary of an employee based on years of experience.

The dataset Consist two columns:- Salary and Years.
                                                              Salary is represented salary of a person and Years are represented years of experience of a person.

For Salary Prediction, We need to find relationship in data on how salary is determined.
                                                              For The Task, We need to have a dataset based on salaries. I found a dataset that contains data about how job experience affects salary.


By using regression analysis, I maked a linear relationship between salary and job experience in which if any employee has more job experience results in a higher salary.

# Problem
Say a company's HR department wants you to build a model to predict new hire salaries based on company data. .csv file shows the data needed to train and test the model.

# Solution


Simple linear regression is used to solve this problem. This suggests that the model will make future decisions for the HR department to predict salaries based on applicant experience.
